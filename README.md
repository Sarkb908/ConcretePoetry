For this assignment, I decided to create a game where the user can choose his or her own adventure. You start off in a room (index.html), that presents you with a couple options. The game is about choosing the right options that will allow you to escape. Either you escape or you are stuck in a room with doors that seem to be endless.
The user can click on the numbers or letters I generated from http://patorjk.com/software/taag/#p=display&f=Graffiti&t=7 which led to other rooms.
Behind door one, you have have door 3 and 4. Door 3 leads to door A and B, which leads to the last page with doors 5 and 6 where the user becomes trapped.
Door 4 also leads to doors A nd B and then leads to the last page, with doors 7 and 8 where the user is trapped.
Only if the user picks Door 2 off of instinct, is when the user will find the right page that allows him or her to escape.

DOOR 1 --> DOOR 3 & 4 --> DOOR A & B --> DOOR 5,6,7,8 // DOOR 2 --> FREEDOM

The most difficult part about this assignment was making sure I stayed organized so my html files can connect to the right pages, and so I do not get lost with the direction of my game. I used styling attributes for the font, tags to bold and italicize, and a list to create my doors that led to other pages.
